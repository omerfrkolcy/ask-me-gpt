# AskMeGPT

AskMeGPT is a project that aims to reproduce the UI and backend functionalities of ChatGPT, leveraging the power of OpenAI APIs. This project is built with a variety of modern libraries and frameworks to provide a seamless and interactive chatbot experience.

## Features

- UI that mimics ChatGPT for a familiar user experience.
- Backend functionalities that replicate ChatGPT's capabilities.
- Integration with OpenAI APIs to leverage the power of GPT-3.5 turbo.
- Use of Vercel KV database (Redis) for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Seamless integration with Vercel for easy deployment and scaling.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We also use Next.js, a React framework, for server-side rendering, static site generation, and more.
- **Backend**: The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, which allows us to build a robust API for our application.
- **OpenAI APIs**: We use OpenAI's powerful GPT-3.5 turbo model to generate human-like text based on the user's input.
- **Vercel KV Database**: We use Vercel's KV database (Redis) for efficient, distributed, and highly available data storage.
- **Vercel Integrations**: Our application is seamlessly integrated with Vercel, enabling easy deployment and scaling.
